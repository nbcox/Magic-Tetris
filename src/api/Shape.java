/**
 * Interface for shapes used by Tetris-like games. Each shape has a position
 * and, implicitly, a set of Cells. The initial position and cell locations are
 * assigned in a constructor, and thereafter the position can be modified by the
 * shiftXXX() methods. The constructor also establishes a relative ordering of
 * the cells. The getCells() method always returns the cells in this ordering,
 * and the cycle() method always uses this ordering. No bounds checking is ever
 * done in implementations of this interface; therefore, the position and the
 * cell positions can have negative coordinates.
