 * Interface for a Tetris-like game. Implementations of this interface should

 * objects representing occupied and unoccupied positions, plus a current Shape
 * whose position is normally updated by the step() method and can be altered by
 * the transform(), shiftDown(), shiftLeft(), and shiftRight() methods. An
 * additional part of the game state is the status that is returned by each
 * invocation of the step() method. The status values are described in detail in
 * the GameStatus documentation.
